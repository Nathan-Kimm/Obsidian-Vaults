	`Answer choices A and B cannot be correct as they are below 50. To choose between C or D you need to match up the ratios. Blue:Red = 1:3 and Red:Green = 2:3. Since red is equal to 3 in the first ratio and then 2 in the second ratio. To match these up multiply the first ratio by 2 and the second ratio by 3 to give, Blue:Red = 2:6 and Red:Green = 6:9. Since the ratio for the red beads are now the same then these ratios can be combined to give Blue:Red:Green = 2:6:9. The smallest number of beads to keep this ratio is 17. The amount of beads on the necklace has to be a multiple of 17 and therefore the smallest number of beads that can be on the necklace is 51.`
