	`In this question, the text suggests that the sample size will be too small to refelct the compositional variations in the asteroid as it would be in a bigger asteroid. Therefore, it is likely that the distribution of minerals will not be unifrom as each small sample will have a different composition. Answer choice B is not correct as redundant means "not or no longer useful or needed" which is too strong of a word.`

	`The word earning is used to introduce an additionlly modifying phrase. The phrase is also set off with a comma. Answer choice A doesn't work as 'earned' requires a subject to work.`

	`The subject in this passage is talents. Therefore, a verb must be used that agrees with that. Answer choice D is correct as all other verbs are singular. "The artistic talens aren't limited" this makes sense.`

	`Choice B is the best answer as the passage starts off by introducing the researcher Claude Shannon. The text then describes a contribution from one his papers then illustrates how important his work was by giving a quotation. Answer choice D is not correct as it is too narrow. The text is more about Shannon's importantce to the field and not just the paper.`

	`In the first text, Ishii and O'Mahony tried to isolate the pure umami flavor. On the other hand, in text 2, Junger aims to recreate soy sauce which has an umami flavor. The umami flavor in text 1 did not have any soy sauce and isntead only had shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed. Therefore, the broths in text 1 most likely did not have much of the dipeptides which would enhance the umami flavor. Choice A is incorrect as there is no mention of the diets of people in the United States in either texts. Answer choice B is incorrect as although there is mention of molecular weights in text 2, there isn't enough mention of molecular weights in text 1 to know what the author would say. Answer choice C is also incorrect as there is only mention of fermentation in Text 1 and that's only for a very brief moment.`

	`Answer choice A works best here as it shows how many Swahili speakers in Tanzania have Swahili as not their first language. If there is an estimated total number of first language Swahili speakers of 15 million and there are 61 million Swahili speakers in Tanzania, then most Swahili speakers in Tanzania do not have Swahili as their first langauge. Answer choice B doesn't work as it is inaccurate. The chart states that there is an approximate 61 million number of swahili speakers in Tanzania but answer chioce B states that Tanzania is estimated at most 15 million.`

	`Read the question carefully, the question asks which quote would most challegne the underlined claim. Therefore, we want an answer that is not idiosyncratic (unique) and allows his work to be viewed through the lens of nationality. In this case, answer chioce D works best as it shows how it's not unique as it relies on a staple of Maya sculpture and allow classification as indigenous art. `

	`With this question, given that` $tan(B) = \frac 3 4$ `and BC = 15. This indicates a 3-4-5 triangle. Since 15 is 3 times 5 the other sides must fit this ratio. Therefore, AC must equal 9 and BA = 12. Since it is given that DA = 4 then DB = 8 since DA + DB must equal 12. Triangle BDE is also a 3-4-5 and since 8 is two times 4. Side DE must be 6.`

	`If the average amount of time that 20 employees worked for the company is 6.7 years. This gives us a total of 20 * 6.7 = 134 years. If one employee left and the average dropped down to 6.25, this gives us 19 * 6.25 = 118.75. 134-118.72 = 15.25 and therefore the answer.`

	`This expression can be rewritten as` $(70n)^{\frac 1 5} ((70n)^{\frac 1 6})^2$ `After applying exponent rules this expression becomes` $(70n)^{\frac 1 5}(70n)^{\frac 1 3}$ `Since these 2 numbers have the same base this can be further rewritten into` $(70n)^{\frac 1 5 + \frac 1 3}$ `or` $(70n)^{\frac 8 {15}}$ `Since the question asks for what value of x is the expression equivalent. Then that means` $(70n)^{\frac 8 {15}} = (70n)^{30x}$  `Since they have the same base this means` $\frac 8 {15} = 30x$ `After simplifying this gives us that` $x = \frac 4 {225}$

	`The total amount, in liters, of a saline can be expressed as the liters of each type of saline solution multiplied by the percent concentration of the saline solution. x(0.25), 3(0.1), (x+3)(0.15), where x is the amount in liters. Since the question is asking how many liters of 25% saline solution must be added to 3 liters of 10% solution to get a 15% saline solution. This means that this equation must be valid:` $x(0.25) + 3(0.1) = (x+3)(0.15)$ `Simplifying this you get` $0.25x + 0.3 = 0.15x + 0.45$ `Further simplifying down to` $0.1x = 0.15$ `Giving us` $x = 1.5$ `Therefore, we would need 1.5 liters of 25% saline solution to obtin a 15% saline solution.`
