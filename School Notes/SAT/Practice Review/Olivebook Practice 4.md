	`Choice B is the best answer as the passage starts off by introducing the researcher Claude Shannon.

	`In the first text, Ishii and O'Mahony tried to isolate the pure umami flavor. On the other hand, in text 2, Junger aims to recreate soy sauce which has an umami flavor. The umami flavor in text 1 did not have any soy sauce and isntead only had shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed. Therefore, the broths in text 1 most likely did not have much of the dipeptides which would enhance the umami flavor. Choice A is incorrect as there is no mention of the diets of people in the United States in either texts. Answer choice B is incorrect as although there is mention of molecular weights in text 2, there isn't enough mention of molecular weights in text 1 to know what the author would say. Answer choice C is also incorrect as there is only mention of fermentation in Text 1 and that's only for a very brief moment.`

	`Answer choice A works best here as it shows how many Swahili speakers in Tanzania have Swahili as not their first language. If there is an estimated total number of first language Swahili speakers of 15 million and there are 61 million Swahili speakers in Tanzania, then most Swahili speakers in Tanzania do not have Swahili as their first langauge. Answer choice B doesn't work as it is inaccurate. The chart states that there is an approximate 61 million number of swahili speakers in Tanzania but answer chioce B states that Tanzania is estimated at most 15 million.`

	`Read the question carefully, the question asks which quote would most challegne the underlined claim. Therefore, we want an answer that is not idiosyncratic (unique) and allows his work to be viewed through the lens of nationality. In this case, answer chioce D works best as it shows how it's not unique as it relies on a staple of Maya sculpture and allow classification as indigenous art. `
