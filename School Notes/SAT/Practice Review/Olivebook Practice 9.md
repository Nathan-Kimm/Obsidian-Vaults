	`Saying that Tom molding the raw materials into a coherent structure doesn't necessarily imply that the structure was elegant. This is further exemplified by the following clause where it shows Tom refining the rough edges and taking shape into a functional design. This doesn't show an elegant design and rather a more organized structure.`

	`Choice A is incorrect as it is an assumption that goes beyond the passage. The soil composition in the region could have changed within the last millennia. Answer choice C is the best answer as the passage begins by saying that researchers were investigating Mayan agricultural practices. Additionally, if the Mayans were pioneers of sustainable farming methods, then it would make sense that the soil composition between the Mayan soil and soil from today's contermporary sustainable farming practices would be similar.`

	`Answer choice C is the best answer. The last sentence offers context the clarifies why the species faces challenge in their migration. If reserachers found that the decrease in milkweek led to a decline in monarch populations, it shows a cause and effect which is a challenge in their migration. Answer choice B is incorrect as the generalization is not exmeplified by the discussion of the monarch butterfly. `

	`The best answer choice is A. Melville saying "As no better man" and "hereupon offer my own poor endeavors" shows that he acknowledges of his humility. This sentence doesn't aim to classify whales but rather sets the tone for a modest attempt at classification which shows the limitations.`

	`Choice C is the correct answer. However fits in the first sentence and the semi colon is needed to seperate the 2 independent clauses. The however is also a supplementary adverb so it's clear that "Patel doesn't conduct fieldwork entirely by herself." would be an independent clause.`

	`This question is testing recognition of boundaries. Answer choice D would be correct as it correctly seperates the 2 independent clauses.`

	`This question is an extremely simple mistake. The equation models in thousands. Therefore, even though the principle is at 32, this represents 32000 which is answer choice B.`

	`Another extremely simplme mistake. The median and range are equal which makes I and III correct. However, II states that the standard deviations are equal which is not the case. Therefore answer choice B is correct.`

	`For this question, make sure to account that the sum of C and D is` $\frac {17} 2$

	`Notice how it states` $cos(A) = \frac {65} {97}$ `Then asks for` $sin(F)$ `Angles A and F are congruent. Remember that` $cos(A) = sin(F)$ `therefore answer choice A is correct.`

	`Its essential to remember for quadratics that sum of solutions:` $\frac {-b} a$ `and product of solutions:` $\frac c a$ `Since in this problem we are given the sum of the solutions we can setup an equation to help us` $ab = \frac a {42}$ `This gives us` $b = \frac 1 {42}$ `Then we move on to the product of solutions. The product of solutions for this equation is` $\frac {\frac 1 b} {42}$ `This can be reformed into` $\frac 1 b * \frac 1 {42}$  `We know that`  $b = \frac 1 {42}$ `So we plug in b and get` $\frac 1 {\frac 1 {42}} * \frac 1 {42}$ `Which simplifies to` $\frac {42} 1 * \frac 1 {42} = 1$ `Which gives us our answer.`

	`The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola can be found by` $\frac {-b} {2a}$ `For this equation the x-coordinate for the vertex can be written as` $\frac b {10}$ `We are given that the vertex is at point (h,1) This means that` $h = \frac b {10}$ or $b = 10h$ `Since it is given that h < 0, then I has to be true. To prove the 2nd statement, with (h,1) we can write` $f(h) = 1$ or $1 = 5h^2 - hb + c$ `This gives us that` $c = 1-5h^2+hb$ `We plug in b and we get` $c = 1 -5h^2 + 10h^2$ `This simplifies down to` $c = 5h^2 +1$ `which is greater than 0 given that h < 0 and therefore II is also correct. This gives us our correct answer of answer choice D.`

	`Remember to read the question very carefully. The question is asking for which would be faster for Mia to use the conventional oven. Therefore we want to see when it would take longer to use a high-efficiency oven compared to the 40 minutes the conventional oven takes. Therefore, answer choice B is the correct answer.`
