	`In this question, I chose answer choice C: Definite. However, in this sentence, using definite would not make sense as saying definite artworks would not make sense. Instead, the word that should be used is vivid. In the first sentence the passage states that "Bold colors of comics, pop art, and Latinx culture have always fascinated her". Additionally the following sentence also says "The passion for the rich history and colors". These sentences would most align with using the word Vivid, Answer Choice C.`

	`For this question make sure to read the entire passage. Although the following sentence after the blank says "Identifying broad similarities between two seemingly different phenomena" this doesn't necessarily mean there is a contradiction. In fact, further into the sentence, the passage talks about how Hu used ants moving inside colonies to calculate how particles of light make up laser beams. This works most with using the word analogy then as the passage is comparing ants moving to particles of light. Therefore, Answer Choice D is correct.

	`In this question, there are two independent clauses. Therefore, answer choices B and D can be eliminated. Choice C doesn't work because semi colons can only be used to ocnnect two independent clauses. If the sentence starts with "though", it is a dependent clause.`

	`In this question, a period should be used to mark the boundary between the first sentence and second sentence. Although it might sound like in the second sentence that the "quiet black-and-white drama about a family in rural India" is describing the movie "Pather Panchali" in the previous sentence. But this is actually describing "Ray's Film", therefore a period is the correct answer.`

	`This question is a subject-verb agreement question. The subject of this question is Amplifying, not the voices and experiences. Therefore the verb needs to singular and therefore should be was. "Amplifying was of particular importantce".`
