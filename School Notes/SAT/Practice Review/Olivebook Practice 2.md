	`The conclusion that is made in the passage sediment influx in streams might have been spatially diffuse (Spread out) which would have prevented the aforementioned sorting effect from being obserfed. Looking at the answer choices, answer choice A makes the most sense as if the streams are experiencing portions of their banks collapsing then sesdiement is getting into the water at those points which supports the conclusion that where the sediment is entering is spread out`

	`Answer choice B does not support the conclusion as the conclusion is talking about how spread out the sediment is and not the type. Answer choice C does not support the conclusion as again it doesn't talk about the influx of sediment being dispersed. Answer choice D does not support the conclusion as it is mentioned in the passage that sediment that enters downstream wouldn't end up in the samples and therefore wouldn't affect the findings or conclusion.`

	`In this question, the passage states that deep sleep leaves animals so vulnerable that the known benefits seem insufficient to explain why so many animals sleep. Therefore the best answer choice would be answer choice A as it would suggest that there are some other benefits that are not yet known.`

	`Answer choice B does not work as the passage only mentions sleep so introducing multiple traits is irrelevant. Answer choice C doesn't work as the passage already mentions that they know how widespread prolonged deep sleep is. Therefore, saying that it is more important to understand how widespread deep sleep is would not logically complete the text. Answer choice D doesn't work as again, only one trait is mentioned: sleep. Therefore, mentioning how many traits could also likely pose risks is again irrelevant.`

	`For this question, you have to recognize that the set of data has a symmetric distribution. This means that the mean and median are equal and therefore the mean is greater than the median by 0 which is answer choice A`

	`In this question, the number of bacteria doubles after every day. At the end of day d, the number of bacteria will be` $10^6 * 2^{d-3}$ . `To find what day you have to do` $10^6 * 2^{d-3} = 5.12*10^8$ `Solving for d you get d-3 = 9 which d = 12 and therefore day = 12.`

	`First rewrite the left equation` $x^{5/2}/x^{4/3}$ `This can then be rewritten as` $x^{5/2-4/3}$ `This equates to` $7/6$

	`The question states that a saleperson's total earnings consist of a base salary of x dollars per year plus commision earnings of 11% of the total sales the salesperson makes during the year. If the salesperson makes s dollars in total sales this year, the saleperson's total earnings can be represented by the expression` $x + 0.11s$ `The sales person has a goal for the total earnings to be at least 3 times and at bost 4 times the base salary. With this information, we can write the inequality,` $3x <= x+0.11s <= 4x$ `This simplifies down to` $2x <= 0.11s <= 3x$ `This simplifies down to` $\frac 2 {0.11x} <= s <= \frac 3 {0.11x}$ `This correlates to answer choice B.`

	`For these questions, make sure to check for extraneous solutions. Solving for x gives you the solution of -1 and 5. However, if you plug in -1 to the equation it does not work and therefore the answer choice is B`
