	`The passage indicates there was a shift in the interpretation of Frost's poem. Frost aimed to mock the indecision of his friend over personal choices that appeared to be trivial. This suggests that the poem is a commentary on the exaggerated importance that people assign to personal decisions, rather than a tribute to bold decision-making.`

	`Answer choice c is not correct as the passage also emphasizes the role of rising nationalism. Answer choice C would overlook this.`

- ![[Inference Example 4.png]]
	`The passage mentions that while some regional dialects such as the deep south have diminished, others such as Boston or New York accents have gotten stronger. Therefore, mentioning how globalization has a varied impact would make the most sense in this context. Answer choice A doesn't work as well as it narrowly focuses on people resisting changes which is also not mentioned in the passage. Answer choice B also doesn't work because there is not evidence in the passage and answer choice C doesn't work because it is an assumption.`
