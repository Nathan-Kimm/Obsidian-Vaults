# Cross-Text Connections Approach:
1. `Read & Summarize both texts`
2. `Capture the Relationship`
3. `Translate the Question`
4. `Use summaries and/or Passage for Relevant Information.`
5. `Predict the Answer`
6. `Process of Elimination`


# Cross-Text Connections Example:
![[Cross-Text Connections Example T1.png| 500]]
**Summary:** `The Great Gatsby has shown growth from Fitzgerald as a writer and it is a cold novel with fake characters`

![[Cross-Text Connections Example T2.png| 500]]
**Summary:** `The characters in The Great Gatsby lack depth on purpose.`

**Step 2:**
`Text 2 explains the reasoning behind the claim behind Text 1`

**Step 3:**
**Question:** `Based on the text, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the assertion in the last line of Text 1 that "You will not find any real people inside?"`
**Translate the Question:**  `How would the author of Text 2 react to Text 1's comment about characters being fake.`

**Step 4:**
**Text 2 Summary:** `The character in The Great Gatsby lack depth on purpose.`
**Text 1 Text:** `Gatsby as a literary creation leaves me cold. Like one of those manicured European parks, it is pleasant to look at, but, like the pages of Fitzgerald's work, you will not find any real people inside.`
**How they Relate:** `Text 2 explains the reasoning behind the claim made in text 1`

**Step 5:**
`Based on the summaries, it can be precicted that the author of text two would tell the author of text one the characters are supposed to lack depth or come across as fake.`

**Step 6:**

`Looking at our prediction and answer choices, answer choice D most relates to having the characters have less depth on purpose. Answer choice A might be tempting, answer choice A does not work the best.`

	`Answer choice A is a trick answer. Answer choice A recycles language and Singh never talked about emphaizing the need to capture the extent to which climate change will impact nudibranchs. Instead, Singh highlights that there are multiple other factors that need to be considered which is why answer choice B makes the most sense. It is likely that Singh would respond to Text 1 by saying that it is oversimpified as in Singh's passage he mentions other factors such as pollution and habitat loss. `

	`The first passage is talking about how a new tax should be levied while the second passage talks about hwo this shouldn't be the case and that every man should have their own option. This therefore shows how the second offers a rebuttal. Answer choice A is close as both passage offer different viewpoints but they do not support the same topic. `
