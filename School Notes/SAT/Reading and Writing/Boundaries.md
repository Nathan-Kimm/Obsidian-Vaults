# Commas:
- ***For lists***
	- `Make sure to bring your calculator, a snack, and your cellphone to the testing center.`
- ***Separate Independent Clauses
	- Need to use a Coordinating Conjunction (FANBOYS) with a comma to separate independent clauses
	- `Many cars these days favor size over agility, and Mike's four-ton SUV is a perfect example.`
- ***Subordinate Clauses***
	- A subordinate clause is the same thing as a dependent clause
	- `Though I like the sense of power that comes with a sports car, I prefer cars that receive good gas mileage.`
- ***"Which"/Adjective Clause***
	- The which describes the object before
	- `He is driving a Tesla, which is an electric car`
- ***Appositives***
	- An appositive is non-essential information that describes the noun
	- `James, who is coming over for dinner tonight, just got back from South America.`
- ***Do not use Commas for "That Clauses"/Essential Clauses***
	- Correct: `I am going to choose a college that is on the East Coast`
	- Incorrect: `I am going to choose a college, that is on the East Coast`
- ***Interrupters***
	- `SUVs are not, as many assume, safe vehicles to drive since they are more likely to tip over during sharp turns than sedans.`
- ***Comma Splices***
	- `The car was expensive, it was equiped with luxury seats.`
	- This is a comma splice because it is combining 2 independent clauses with a comma. A period or semicolon should be used instead.


# Semicolons:
- ***To Separate Independent Clauses***
	- Correct: `Few students take advantage of the semicolon; consequeuntly, their essays end up lacking sophistication.`
	- Cannot use FANBOYS/Coordinating Conjunction with semicolon
	- Incorrect: `Few students take advantage of the semicoon; so their essays end up lacking sophistication.`
- ***Semicolons can join Independent Clauses that Cannot be Connected by Conjunctions but that Have a Parallel Structure.
	- `It was a difficult day; it was a terrible day.`
	- `He had a curious mind capable of digesting anything; he had an irrepressible spirit incapable of giving up.
	- `Climate chanage is a real threat; it must be dealt with by real solutions.`


# Dashes:
- ***To List Items Mid-Sentence
	- `I like all kinds of desserts-pies, cobblers, brownies, cupcakes- but there is something about cheesecake that doesn't sit well with me.`
- ***To Elaborate Upon Something Mid sentence***
	- `Though he had found the perfect motorcycle-it could outrace a Ferrari- he didn't have the money to buy it.
	- Also Correct: `Though he had found the perfect motorcycle (it was the one he had seen in the magazine), he didn't have the money to buy it.`


# Colons:
- ***Lists***
	- `There are several things I must bring on my camping trip in Utah: hiking poles, hiking shoes, a sturdy backpack, and canned food.`
- ***To Announce Something***
	- `He had one goal in life: become the best hacky-sack player ever`
	- `Though later in life he was wrong, in high school he believed that success on the SAT amounted to the following: a great school, a great job, and a great life.`


# The Versatility of Punctuation:
1. `He was very fond of comic books; he owned the entire Marvel series.`
2. `He was very fond of comic books. He owned the entire Marvel series.
3. `He was very fond of comic books, owning the entire Marvel series
	- The participle is setting off an adjective phrase and it describes "him"
		- A participle is a word formed from a verb and used as an adjective 
		- Ex. To burn -> Burning
	- Independent clause + comma + participle
	- If there is no comma it describes the object:
		- `He was very fond of comic books covering the life of a misunderstood hero
			- The participle now describes the comic book
4. `He was very fond of comic books and owned the entire Marvel series.
5. `He was very fond of comic books, and he owned the entire Marvel series.


# Examples:
- ![[Boundaries Example 1.png]]
	- `In this sentence, the dash used in answer choice A redefines the First Asiatic Zoological Expedition. In this case a dash is acceptable. Choice D is mostly correct except for the word being. For the SAT when you see a word such as being or any -ing words, see if replacing it with "which" or nothing at all makese sense. If it does, then the answer choice is wrong.`
- ![[Boundaries Example 2.png]]
	- `Remember that yet is a coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS). Therefore, doing ",yet" would correctly seperate the two independent clauses.`

- ![[Boundaries Example 3.png]]
	- `Remember about the use of complex series. A complex series is the punctuation of items with internal punctuation like commas In this sentence, semicolons are used to seperate the items in the list. Although it might not look right to do "; and" make sure to look for a complex list.`

- ![[Boundaries Example 4.png]]
	`A clause starting with since is not an independent clause and therefore a semi colon cannot be used. A comma should be used instead as it seperates the main clause from the supplementary clause. The main clause is "However, the original purpose of the brass studs was practical" The clause that comes after practical is supplmentary and is adding on.
