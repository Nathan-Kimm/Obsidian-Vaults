**1. Missing the big picture**
- `You look at a word or two in context`
- `You don't focus on what the blank is actually saying`
- `Usually pertains to questions where you have to put the word in the blank`
- `Can relate to reading passage where you look at specific words instead of the entire sentence(s)`

**2. Assuming too much**
- `The correct answer has to be backed up by specific text in the passage`
- `If something seems like it's true or could be true, that is a trap answer`
- `Don't try to be creative and make connections`
- `Standardized test have to have one correct answer`
- `Also avoid answer choices with extreme words such as always or only`
