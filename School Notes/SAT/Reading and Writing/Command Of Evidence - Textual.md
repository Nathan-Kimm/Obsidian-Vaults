# Types of Command of Evidence - Textual Questions
- **Literary Evidence**: Passage makes a claim about a particular literary work (eg., a poem or novel).
- **Scientific Evidence**: Hypothesis is presented about a subject in science or social science.


# Command of Evidence Textual Question Approach
1. `Read the entire paragraph`
2. `Identify the claim/argument`
3. `Identify the evidence used to support the argument`
4. `Summarize the claim/argument`
5. `Determine whether to help or hurt the claim`
6. `Make a prediction`
7. `Use process of elimination based on prediction`

***Step 2:*** `The claim made in this passage is that malaria can be eradicated in an area if all mosquitoes carrying malaria were exterminated`
***Step 3:*** `The evidence that is used in the passage is that "Malaria passes into the human population when a mosquito carrying malaria bites a human" and "The disease cannot be passed from human to human unless a non-infected person is exposed to the blood of an infected person`
***Step 4:*** `Malaria is usually spread from mosquito to person, rarely human to human, so if you kill all the mosquitos in an area, malaria can be eradicated`
***Step 5:*** `The question asks which would be true to make eliminating malaria not viable. Is not viable means to hurt the claim`
***Step 6:*** `Prediction: Show that there is another way for malaria to keep spreading so it cannot be fully destroyed.`
***Step 7:*** `Based on the prediction made in the previous step, it is clear that answer choice A would make the most sense as it shows another way malaria can continue to spread.`

	`The question wants a quotation that shows how free imagination can be. Answer choice C works best for this question as "Leaving the rolling universe behind" metaphorically captures the notion of escpaing the physical and social restrictions. Although answer choice D does illustrate the expansiveness of imagination, the quotation talks more about exploring the vast universe over talking about the mental liberation from life's constraints.`

	`The passage needs a quotation that shows unfairness as well as Achilles' decision to cease fighting. Answer chioce C partially covers this as it shows how unfair it is but doesn't demonstrate the fight stopping. Therefore answer choice A would make the most sense as it shows Achilles withdrawing the fight and shows how unfair it is by saying "brimming your cup and piling up your plunder"`

	`Answer choice A doesn't work as it compares too much about what the Colossus of Rhodes wasn't and not comparing the two. Answer choice B isn't correct because it mainly only focuses on the status of liberty. Answer chioce D isn't right as it doesn't exactly contrast the two colossus. Answer choice C is the correct option. In answer choice C, it's like the Status of Libery saying goodbye to the old colussus: "Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp." The answer choice then represents a shift from the old colossus to the new one as it states "Give me your tired, your poor"`

	`Answer choice A doesn't work as well as although it shows Mrs. Bennet talking about the advantages of the marriage, it doesn't necessarily show her boasting. Answer choice B also doesn't work because it does show Mrs. Bennet thinking about the rest of her family because of the marriage, it doesn't show her being arrogant. Answer choice C works best as it shows that Mrs. Bennet is a little condescending and boastful as she states "though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it."`

	`Although answer choice A does show a bond between the marines, it doesn't demonstrate that these bonds are created through their time during the USMC Recruit Training Program. Answer choice B better demonstrates this as it shows how at the beginning of the program they worked independelty but later on they did more collaborative work which demonstrates that they've grown a bond as they have gone through the program.`

	`Although the passage says "comparing them to pie-crusts" none of the answer choices specifically mention a pie crust. However, you want to look for an answer that resembles pie cruts best. Therefore, answer choice A works best. Answer choice A basically states "lets not make any promises so we never break them" as can be seen by "Promise me no promises." This shows how fragile promises really are similar to how fragile pie crusts are. Answer choice D doesn't work as well as it doesn't specifically highlight the fragileness of promises like answer choice A.`
