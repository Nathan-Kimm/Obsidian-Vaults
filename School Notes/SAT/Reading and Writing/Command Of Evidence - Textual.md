# Types of Command of Evidence - Textual Questions
- **Literary Evidence**: Passage makes a claim about a particular literary work (eg., a poem or novel).
- **Scientific Evidence**: Hypothesis is presented about a subject in science or social science.


# Command of Evidence Textual Question Approach
1. `Read the entire paragraph`
2. `Identify the claim/argument`
3. `Identify the evidence used to support the argument`
4. `Summarize the claim/argument`
5. `Determine whether to help or hurt the claim`
6. `Make a prediction`
7. `Use process of elimination based on prediction`

***Common Trap Answer***: "Change in terms".

***Step 2:*** `The claim made in this passage is that malaria can be eradicated in an area if all mosquitoes carrying malaria were exterminated`
***Step 3:*** `The evidence that is used in the passage is that "Malaria passes into the human population when a mosquito carrying malaria bites a human" and "The disease cannot be passed from human to human unless a non-infected person is exposed to the blood of an infected person`
***Step 4:*** `Malaria is usually spread from mosquito to person, rarely human to human, so if you kill all the mosquitos in an area, malaria can be eradicated`
***Step 5:*** `The question asks which would be true to make eliminating malaria not viable. Is not viable means to hurt the claim`
***Step 6:*** `Prediction: Show that there is another way for malaria to keep spreading so it cannot be fully destroyed.`
***Step 7:*** `Based on the prediction made in the previous step, it is clear that answer choice A would make the most sense as it shows another way malaria can continue to spread.`

	`The passage needs a quotation that shows unfairness as well as Achilles' decision to cease fighting. Answer chioce C partially covers this as it shows how unfair it is but doesn't demonstrate the fight stopping. Therefore answer choice A would make the most sense as it shows Achilles withdrawing the fight and shows how unfair it is by saying "brimming your cup and piling up your plunder"`

	`Answer choice A doesn't work as it compares too much about what the Colossus of Rhodes wasn't and not comparing the two. Answer choice B isn't correct because it mainly only focuses on the status of liberty. Answer chioce D isn't right as it doesn't exactly contrast the two colossus.
