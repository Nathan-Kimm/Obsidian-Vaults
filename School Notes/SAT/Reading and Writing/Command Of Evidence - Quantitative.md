# Command of Evidence Quantitative Question Approach:
1. `Do an initial skim of the graph`
		`Focus on title, labels, units, keys, legends, etc`
2. `Read the text and the question`
		`Text contextualizes the data from step 1. Text and question sets up what to do with the data in order to support the argument being made.`
3. `Identify the argument you need to support`
4. `Use process of elimination to find supporting evidence in the answer choices.`
		`Eliminate any answer choices that are factually inaccurate based on the data presented. Watch out for information supported by the grpah but not supported by the argument made in the text.`

***Step 1:*** `The graph shows what occupations art school graduates went on to out of 1.9 million graduates.`
***Step 2:*** `The text indicates that only few talented individuals go on to achieve success doing full time art.`
***Step 3:*** `The correct answer choice should indicate that not many people go on to become full time artists`
***Step 4:*** `Looking at the options, it is clear that answer choice A makes the most sense as it illustrates that only 10% of graduates become full-time artists.`

	- `For quantitative questions, make sure that the answer choice aligns with what they were trying to say. For example, for this question, answer Choice B aligns with the trend that as the body size increases the exoskeleton does as well. Answer Choice D for example shows a similar trend but flips it around which isn't the best answer choice.`
