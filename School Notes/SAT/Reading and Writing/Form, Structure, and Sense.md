# The three Pronoun Cases:

| Subjective |  Possessive  | Objective |
| :--------: | :----------: | :-------: |
|     I      |   My/Mine    |    me     |
|     We     |   Our/Ours   |    Us     |
|   He/She   |   His/Hers   |  Him/Her  |
|    Who     |    Whose     |   Whom    |
|    They    | Their/Theirs |   Them    |
|     It     |     Its      |    It     |
|    You     |     Your     |    You    |

- ## Subjective Pronouns do the action:
	`- I went to the store`
	`- He is the best singer in the group`
- ## Objective pronouns receive the action:
	`- Sharon wants to give them cookies`
	`- Please give Sharon's cookies to us`
- ## Possessive pronouns show ownership:
	`- The dog was licking its fur`
	`- Jennifer treasures all of her books`
	
	 
# Watch our for Compound Subjects with Pronouns:
	- "Mary and me went to the store"
		- Doesn't sound terrible but it is wrong. For these questions,                      cross out the other person and read the sentence.
	- "Me went to the store" definitely sounds wrong
	 - Should be "I went to the store"

	Example: "The other fans and us/we rushed the stage after the              performance."
		Although "The other fans and us..." might sound better, "us rushed        the stage" does not make sense. Therefore, should be "The other            fans and we"


# Watch out for Pronouns in Prepositional Phrases
	- Particularly when the pronoun "you" is involved
	- You and me/I are going to grab burritos for lunch
		- I should be used here because it is the subject
	- Between you and me/I, I really don't like eating burritos
		- In the preposition, you always want to object pronoun.                  Therefore, me should be used.


# "Its" vs "It's" and "Whose" vs "Who's
	- It's = it is; Who's = who is
	- Its and whose are possesive pronouns


# Pronoun and Antecedents
	- A pronoun always has an antecedent(the word the pronoun is replacing)
	- Ex. Al Gore worked tirelessly to promote his documentary An             inconvenient Truth
		- Pronoun: his
		- Antecedent: Al gore


# Pronoun Agreement
	- The number must agree with its antecedent in terms of number
	- In the SAT, they/them/their is never used for a singular noun even         if gender is not known
		- Ex. The student picked up their grades
		- Their would not be correct in this sentence and should be his/her

|         Singular         |    Plural     |
| :----------------------: | :-----------: |
|       He, She, It        |     They      |
|       Him, Her, It       |     Them      |
|    His, Her, Hers, It    | Their, Theirs |
| Himself, Herself, Itself |  Themselves   |


# Watch out for Collective and Compound Nouns
	- Collective Nouns (army, class, committee, team) usually require                   singular pronouns
		- Ex. The Graduating class fulfilled its community service                               requirements.
	- Unless they are acting as individuals
		- Ex. The Committee argued amongst themselves about whether they                         should hire someone external to the company.
	- Compound Nouns require Plural Pronouns
		- Ex) The president and the vice president always travel with                            their security details

# Subject Verb Agreement
	- Remember that the subject may not appear directly in front of the          verb
	
		![[Form Structure and Sense Example 2.png|300]]
		Here, it should be covers and is because the range is singular

	- Remember that the subject may also appear after the verb
	
		![[Form, Structure, and Sense Example 1.png|300]]
		In this for example, the shells is the subject. You can reverse the sentence to see more easily. The shells is plural and therefore lie the collected is correct. The sentence can also be written as, Shells from our evening beach walks lie on the mantle.

			That of is neeeded in this sentence as it shows that they                         comparing their styles not Orwell's style to Aldous.                              Additionally, that of is already possessive so it should not be                   Huxley's.

		- A is not correct because it is comparing the use of mercury-free                   vaccines to vaccines

		`He doesn't like chocolate but he does like Vanilla.`

# Examples
- ![[Form, Structure, and Sense Example 4.png]]
	- `"This Grassroot effort is the noun phrase that it modifies. Since "grassroot effort" is a singular phrase, "its" is the correct singular possessive determiner. This indicates that Roosevelt was the most influential champion on the effort.`
- ![[Form, Structure, and Sense Example 5.png]]
	- `For this question, although both B and C are gramatically correct, B with the ", which" indicates a non-essential clause. In this case, the following information is essential and therefore that should be used.`
- ![[Form, Structure, and Sense Example 6.png]]
	- `The subject in this sentence is the group of hydrologists. Therefore, the verb must also be plural to agree with the plural subject. "Have Demonstrated" is the correct plural present perfect tense. Present perfect tense is used when an event occured at an unknown time.`
- ![[Form, Structure, and Sense Example 7.png]]
		- `Although "has made" might make sense, it is not the best choice because of the specific time reference (by its 30th anniversary in 2020). In this case the past perfect tense should be used "had made" because Hubble making more than 1.3 million observations happened before its 30th anniversary.`
