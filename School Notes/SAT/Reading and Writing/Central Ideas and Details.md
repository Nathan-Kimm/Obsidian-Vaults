Looking at the answer choices, it is clear that the answer choice would be A as the passage shows us how the new evidence from GPR makes Reeves' theory not possible.

B cannot be the answer as the passage doesn't talk about any biographical details of Nefertiti's life

C cannot be the answer as the evidence that Nicholas Reeves used was not compromised and instead new evidence was brought up.

D cannot be the answer as although the new technology might revolution archaeology. It is not exactly the main idea of the passage and more of an assumption.
